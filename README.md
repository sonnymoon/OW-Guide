## The Basics

### The Game
Overwatch is an objective based first person shooter game based on classes and character types. The goal of a match is to fulfill the objective requirements. Within the set time limits, game conditions, and/or better than the opposing team. Each map falls into a mode category. The four modes are: Assault, Control, Escort, and Hybrid.

Assault, also known as 2CP (Capture Point) is a mode in which teams take turns trying to attack capture points that the enemy is defending. There are two points, A and B, for each of these maps and the attacking team captures them by standing within the boundaries of the point uncontested. When a team is successful in capturing the first point, they are given bonus time to capture the next point. Overtime can be triggered if all the time has run out, but at least one member of the attacking team is present on the point at most three seconds before the timer hits zero. After a team's attempt, whether they were successful in taking both points or not, the sides are switched and the other team has an opportunity to attack. If the second attacking team is able to capture more points or percentage of the points than the first attacking team, then the second team wins. If both teams are successful in capturing both points, then both teams are given another chance, starting with the team that has less time left on the clock. The game can end in a draw if both teams are able to capture the same number of points.

Control, also known as King of the Hill, is a mode in which both teams fight for control of a single control point. The point is captured in the same manner as described above.  If the point is in possession of one team, the other team can capture it so long as they are uncontested. A team wins the round when they have 100% possession of the point, as denoted in the percentage at the top of the screen. The match is played in a best two out of three style and each round is a different. This game mode cannot end in a draw."version" or "section" of the map.

Escort is a mode in which teams take turns delivering a payload vehicle through three checkpoints. The payload moves when it is uncontested by the enemy team and will have varying speeds depending on the map and how many of the attacking team's members are in proximity of the payload. Each time a payload reaches a checkpoint, the attacking team is awarded some bonus time. If the timer runs out or the team is successful in delivering the payload all the way to the end, the turns switch and the other team has an opportunity to do the same. If both teams are successful in delivering the payload all the way, both teams get another chance, starting with the team that has less team left on the clock. This game mode cannot end in a draw.

Hybrid is a mode that draws elements from Assault and Escort. The attacking team must first capture a point before the payload is available to push. All the same conditions mentioned above apply here. This game can end in a draw if both teams have the same capture percentage of a point. 

There are other game modes in the Arcade, but they will not be addressed in this guide.

### The Characters
All the characters are grouped up in the following role categories: Tanks, Damage, and Support. Tanks tend to have higher health gauges, but have deficiencies in other abilities. Damage has lots of utility for dealing damage or eliminating enemy players, but lack the sustainability to survive on their own. Support has the ability to heal teammates and/or themselves, but lack the damage abilities to defend themselves or deal substantial damage. These are just generalizations, but there are exceptions like "Soldier: 76" who can use a health regenerative device or "Zenyatta" who is able to deal a lot of damage. Each character has their own abilities and ultimates.

## How to actually play Overwatch 

### The Roles
While each character falls under one of the three roles defined by Overwatch, players usually define other roles that are useful in building a competitive team.

The Main Tank is a tank that is able to create space for the team. Contrary to popular belief, the Main Tank does not have to have a shield to accomplish this and there are multiple ways that a main tank can function. For Reinhardt and Orisa, a shield is utilized to mark the area that the team "owns". The presence of the shield or the presence of the tank should denote where the team is able to exist, safely for the most part. For Winston and Wrecking Ball, the tank jumps past the invisible boundary between the teams to force the enemy to retreat backwards to either defend vulnerable players or punish the intruder.

The Off Tank is a tank that is able to preserve the space that the main tank creates and/or assist in creating the space. There are some main tank off tank combinations that work best, but the point of the off tank remains the same. In addition to complementing the main tank, the off tank should also be able to protect vulnerable players on the team in a process known as "peeling".

The Main Support is a support that is primarily focused on healing the team and usually has some abilities that can provide a large quantity of healing and/or healing to multiple teammates at a time. The main support is able to provide other utility as well, but should prioritize sustaining the team.

The Off Support is a support that also provides healing for the team but is more often useful for other utlity abilities. The off support can help with dealing more damage, countering specific characters or playstyles, or any sort of boost that the team may need.

The Damage role is divided into Hitscan, Projectile, or Flex. Hitscan characters have weapons that deal damage as soon as the weapon is used (e.g. a sniper rifle). Projectile characters have weapons that deal damage after the travel time of the projectile. Flex characters make up the remainder of the damage role and is more so a way to describe the player. Flex players are able to play characters that do not have weapons that fill into the traditional hitscan or projectile description, but are also able to play hitscan or projectile characters as needed for the team.

### Ultimates
The point of ultimates are to make a fair situation unfair in favor of the team. This means that
